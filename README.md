Hello! My name is Cory Gold. For the first part of my adult life, I spent my days thinking of creative ways to help people be their best selves through proper exercise and nutrition. However, I was working long hours traveling between clients and was unable to spend as much time with my family. Naturally, my own mental and physical health began to suffer. 

Three years ago I was introduced to software engineering by a good friend of mine who told me how much he truly enjoyed his career. He shared with me how he spent his days solving complex problems and creating outstanding user experiences, while at the same time having the freedom to take care of his health and wellbeing. 

Since then, I have spent my time teaching myself and attending an immersive, full-time software engineering boot camp to arm myself with the skills necessary to thrive as a software engineer.

Before I was helping people be their best selves through exercise and nutrition, now, I get to help people by creating applications that are intuitive and delightful to use, while having the time and energy to take care of myself and my family, too.

My current tech stack includes:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- React.js
- Redux
- Node.js
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL
